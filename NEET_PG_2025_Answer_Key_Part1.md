# NEET PG 2025: COMPLETE ANSWER KEY (Part 1)
Questions 1-60 with Detailed Explanations

## SECTION A: PRE-CLINICAL SUBJECTS (28 Questions)

### ANATOMY (10 Questions)

**Q1. Answer: b) Right coronary artery - inferior wall infarction with right bundle branch block**
**Explanation**: ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates inferior wall myocardial infarction, which is typically caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery. The right coronary artery supplies the inferior surface of the heart, and its occlusion leads to infarction of the inferior wall. Right bundle branch block can occur due to involvement of the right bundle branch, which is supplied by the right coronary artery.

**Q2. Answer: b) Left recurrent laryngeal nerve - loops around the aortic arch and runs in tracheoesophageal groove**
**Explanation**: The recurrent laryngeal nerve is vulnerable during thyroid surgery because it runs in the tracheoesophageal groove and loops around the aortic arch (left) or subclavian artery (right). Damage to this nerve causes paralysis of the ipsilateral vocal cord, leading to hoarseness and difficulty in swallowing. The nerve supplies all intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid.

**Q3. Answer: b) Axillary nerve - runs with posterior circumflex humeral artery, would cause deltoid paralysis and loss of shoulder abduction**
**Explanation**: The axillary nerve is most commonly injured in fractures of the surgical neck of the humerus. It runs with the posterior circumflex humeral artery and supplies the deltoid muscle and teres minor. Injury results in loss of shoulder abduction (deltoid paralysis) and sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the upper arm (superior lateral cutaneous nerve of arm).

**Q4. Answer: b) Medial circumflex femoral artery - provides blood supply through retinacular vessels and is often compromised in subcapital fractures**
**Explanation**: The medial circumflex femoral artery is the primary blood supply to the femoral head through retinacular vessels. In subcapital fractures, these vessels are often compromised, leading to avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This is why subcapital fractures have a high risk of complications.

**Q5. Answer: b) Optic chiasma - compression of crossing fibers causes bitemporal hemianopia**
**Explanation**: Compression of the optic chiasma by a pituitary adenoma affects the crossing fibers from the nasal retina of both eyes, resulting in bitemporal hemianopia. The nasal retina fibers cross in the chiasma, while temporal retina fibers remain uncrossed.

**Q6. Answer: b) Lower esophageal sphincter - failure of relaxation due to loss of inhibitory neurons in Auerbach's plexus**
**Explanation**: Achalasia is characterized by failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter due to loss of inhibitory neurons in Auerbach's plexus. This results in the "bird's beak" appearance on barium swallow and symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation.

**Q7. Answer: c) Ampulla of Vater - obstruction causes both jaundice and steatorrhea**
**Explanation**: Obstruction at the ampulla of Vater affects both the common bile duct and pancreatic duct, leading to both jaundice (biliary obstruction) and steatorrhea (pancreatic insufficiency). This is characteristic of pancreatic head masses.

**Q8. Answer: c) Pia mater - inflammation causes meningeal irritation and signs**
**Explanation**: Meningeal signs (neck stiffness, Kernig's sign, Brudzinski's sign) are caused by inflammation of the pia mater and arachnoid mater, which irritate the nerve roots. This is the basis for the clinical presentation of meningitis.

**Q9. Answer: a) Right internal capsule - causes left hemiplegia due to decussation of motor fibers**
**Explanation**: The corticospinal tract decussates at the medullary pyramids, so a lesion in the right internal capsule causes left hemiplegia. The internal capsule contains the corticospinal fibers that control voluntary movement.

**Q10. Answer: a) Hypothalamus - secretes GnRH to regulate pituitary function**
**Explanation**: The hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) which regulates the secretion of FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary. In polycystic ovary syndrome, there is dysfunction of this hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

### PHYSIOLOGY (10 Questions)

**Q11. Answer: b) Decreased glomerular filtration rate - kidneys compensate by increasing renin secretion and activating RAAS**
**Explanation**: In chronic kidney disease, decreased GFR leads to elevated serum creatinine. The kidneys attempt to compensate by increasing renin secretion and activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to maintain glomerular filtration.

**Q12. Answer: c) Both increased heart rate and stroke volume - due to increased sympathetic activity, increased venous return, and Frank-Starling mechanism**
**Explanation**: During exercise, cardiac output increases through both increased heart rate and stroke volume. This is mediated by increased sympathetic activity, increased venous return, and the Frank-Starling mechanism.

**Q13. Answer: b) Decreased ADH secretion (central diabetes insipidus) - would show low ADH levels and dilute urine**
**Explanation**: Central diabetes insipidus is characterized by decreased ADH secretion, leading to dilute urine and hypernatremia. The urine osmolality is low (<300 mOsm/kg) and serum osmolality is high.

**Q14. Answer: b) Decreased potassium secretion by the distal tubule - due to decreased aldosterone activity or aldosterone resistance**
**Explanation**: Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is characterized by hyperkalemia due to decreased potassium secretion by the distal tubule, which is often due to decreased aldosterone activity or aldosterone resistance.

**Q15. Answer: a) Primary thyroid disorder - elevated thyroid hormones suppress TSH through negative feedback on pituitary**
**Explanation**: In primary hyperthyroidism, elevated thyroid hormones (T3, T4) suppress TSH through negative feedback on the pituitary gland. This is the characteristic hormonal profile of Graves' disease or toxic nodular goiter.

**Q16. Answer: b) Release of pancreatic enzymes from damaged pancreatic acinar cells - due to autodigestion**
**Explanation**: In acute pancreatitis, pancreatic enzymes are released from damaged acinar cells due to autodigestion. This leads to elevated serum amylase and lipase levels within hours of the injury.

**Q18. Answer: b) Release of preformed enzymes from damaged myocardial cells - occurs within hours of myocardial injury**
**Explanation**: Cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB, LDH) are released from damaged myocardial cells within hours of myocardial injury. Troponin I rises within 3-4 hours and remains elevated for 7-10 days.

**Q19. Answer: a) Increased uric acid production due to increased purine metabolism - due to increased nucleic acid turnover**
**Explanation**: Hyperuricemia in gout is often due to increased uric acid production from increased purine metabolism, which can occur due to increased nucleic acid turnover or dietary factors.

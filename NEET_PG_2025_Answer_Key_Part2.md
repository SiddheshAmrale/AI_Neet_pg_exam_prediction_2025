# NEET PG 2025: COMPLETE ANSWER KEY (Part 2)
Questions 61-100 with Detailed Explanations

## SECTION C: CLINICAL SUBJECTS (140 Questions)

### MEDICINE & ALLIED (40 Questions)

**Q61. Answer: b) Right coronary artery - would cause inferior wall MI with right bundle branch block, requires immediate PCI**
**Explanation**: ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates inferior wall myocardial infarction, which is caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery. This requires immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow and minimize myocardial damage.

**Q62. Answer: b) Add basal insulin (glargine) once daily - since patient has poor glycemic control despite oral therapy**
**Explanation**: The patient has poor glycemic control (HbA1c 8.5%) despite maximum oral therapy. Adding basal insulin (glargine) once daily is the most appropriate next step for patients with type 2 diabetes who fail oral therapy.

**Q63. Answer: b) Oral amoxicillin for 7 days - since patient has mild CAP with typical organism**
**Explanation**: The patient has mild community-acquired pneumonia with a typical organism (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Oral amoxicillin for 7 days is the standard treatment for mild CAP with typical organisms.

**Q64. Answer: c) Combination of oral iron and ESA - since patient has both iron deficiency and CKD anemia**
**Explanation**: The patient has both iron deficiency (low ferritin, low transferrin saturation) and CKD anemia. Treatment requires both oral iron supplementation and erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) to address both conditions.

**Q65. Answer: b) Acetazolamide therapy - since it reduces CSF production**
**Explanation**: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is treated with acetazolamide, which reduces cerebrospinal fluid production by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase. This helps lower intracranial pressure.

**Q66. Answer: d) Combination therapy with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics - since patient has severe exacerbation**
**Explanation**: The patient has severe COPD exacerbation with respiratory acidosis. Treatment requires combination therapy with bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics for optimal management.

**Q67. Answer: b) Intravenous insulin therapy with fluid resuscitation - since patient has DKA**
**Explanation**: The patient has diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with metabolic acidosis. Treatment requires intravenous insulin therapy with fluid resuscitation to correct the acidosis and restore normal physiology.

**Q68. Answer: b) Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) - since patient has acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours**
**Explanation**: The patient has acute ischemic stroke and is within the 4.5-hour window for thrombolytic therapy. Intravenous tPA is the standard treatment for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke.

**Q69. Answer: c) Supportive care with rest and hydration - since patient has self-limiting viral illness**
**Explanation**: Infectious mononucleosis is a self-limiting viral illness caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Treatment is supportive with rest and hydration. Antibiotics are not indicated and can cause rash.

**Q70. Answer: c) Deep brain stimulation surgery - since patient has advanced disease with motor fluctuations**
**Explanation**: The patient has advanced Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations despite medical therapy. Deep brain stimulation surgery is indicated for patients with advanced disease and motor fluctuations.

**Q71. Answer: b) Levothyroxine therapy with gradual dose titration - since patient has primary hypothyroidism**
**Explanation**: The patient has primary hypothyroidism (elevated TSH, low T4). Treatment is levothyroxine therapy with gradual dose titration to normalize TSH levels.

**Q72. Answer: c) Supportive care with fluid resuscitation and pain control - since patient has mild pancreatitis**
**Explanation**: The patient has mild acute pancreatitis (no organ failure, no necrosis). Treatment is supportive care with fluid resuscitation and pain control. Surgical intervention is not indicated.

**Q73. Answer: b) Hydroxychloroquine therapy - since patient has mild SLE without major organ involvement**
**Explanation**: The patient has mild systemic lupus erythematosus without major organ involvement. Hydroxychloroquine is the first-line treatment for mild SLE to control symptoms and prevent flares.

**Q74. Answer: d) Combination therapy with lactulose and rifaximin - since patient has severe hepatic encephalopathy**
**Explanation**: The patient has severe hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment requires combination therapy with lactulose (to reduce ammonia absorption) and rifaximin (to reduce bacterial overgrowth).

**Q75. Answer: b) Intravenous antihypertensive therapy with immediate blood pressure reduction - since patient has hypertensive emergency**
**Explanation**: The patient has hypertensive emergency (BP >180/120 with end-organ damage). Treatment requires immediate blood pressure reduction with intravenous antihypertensive therapy.

**Q76. Answer: c) Four-drug therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol - since patient has active tuberculosis**
**Explanation**: The patient has active pulmonary tuberculosis. Standard treatment is four-drug therapy with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months.

**Q77. Answer: c) Intravenous antibiotic therapy with surgical debridement - since patient has osteomyelitis**
**Explanation**: The patient has diabetic foot ulcer with osteomyelitis (exposed bone, elevated inflammatory markers). Treatment requires intravenous antibiotics and surgical debridement.

**Q78. Answer: d) Combination therapy with antibiotics and corticosteroids - since patient has pneumococcal meningitis**
**Explanation**: The patient has pneumococcal meningitis. Treatment requires combination therapy with antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) and corticosteroids (dexamethasone) to reduce complications.

**Q79. Answer: c) Combination of oral iron and ESA - since patient has both iron deficiency and CKD anemia**
**Explanation**: The patient has both iron deficiency and CKD anemia. Treatment requires both oral iron supplementation and erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA) to address both conditions.

**Q80. Answer: d) Combination therapy with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics - since patient has severe exacerbation**

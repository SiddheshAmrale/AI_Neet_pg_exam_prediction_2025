## ANSWER KEY AND EXPLANATIONS

### Section A: Pre-Clinical (28 Questions)

**Q1. Answer: b) Right coronary artery - inferior wall infarction with right bundle branch block**
**Explanation**: ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF indicates inferior wall myocardial infarction, which is typically caused by occlusion of the right coronary artery. The right coronary artery supplies the inferior surface of the heart, and its occlusion leads to infarction of the inferior wall. Right bundle branch block can occur due to involvement of the right bundle branch, which is supplied by the right coronary artery.

**Q2. Answer: b) Left recurrent laryngeal nerve - loops around the aortic arch and runs in tracheoesophageal groove**
**Explanation**: The recurrent laryngeal nerve is vulnerable during thyroid surgery because it runs in the tracheoesophageal groove and loops around the aortic arch (left) or subclavian artery (right). Damage to this nerve causes paralysis of the ipsilateral vocal cord, leading to hoarseness and difficulty in swallowing. The nerve supplies all intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid.
